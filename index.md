# Background for this Website

At the beginning of 2017, I stumbled across an amazing video called the _Map of Mathematics_ by the Domain of Science.  The video essentially connected a wide variety of mathematical fields together into one concise web, highlighting how certain fields build upon others.  

At the time, I felt that despite challenging myself in several applied mathematical courses in college, I still lacked a strong foundation in rigorous analysis.  Further, most graduate level texts that I found online seemed devoid of pictures or other visuals that assisted in explaining abstract material.  As a visual learner, this dearth of imagery hindered my enthusiasm for the topic.

Thus, after watching the _Map of Mathematics_, I set a challenge for myself:  

I wanted to master as many of the mentioned mathematical fields as possible.  

This goal would not only satisfy my own curiosity and assist my other studies, but would hopefully be a wonderful venue for me to add imagery to these often dense topics that could ultimately help others learn the material as well.  

# Structure of the Website

This website is to be structured in the following way.  I will use seminal texts (mostly free and online), and provide blogs working through several theorems and problems from each chapter, adding visuals to assist each webpage.  

Each subsection of the website is devoted to a field.  On this main page, I will eventually keep track of the work that I have accomplished to date.  

Of course, at the bottom of each page, feedback is much appreciated.  Mathematics is a collaborate sport, and I look forward to pointers and advice along the way!
