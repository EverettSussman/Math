# Major Theorems and Definitions

## Definition 15
Here, we will visualize many of the new terms given in this definition.  For all of these definitions, $X$ is a metric space with a distance function $d$.

* Neighborhoods: a **neighborhood** of $p$ is a set $N_r(p)$ consisting of all $q$ such that $d(p,q) < r$ for some $r > 0$.  The number $r$ is the **radius** of $N_r(p)$.  

The below image helps to visualize a neighborhood in $E$.

Note that $N_r(p)$ is not necessarily the entirety of the shaded orange region, but rather the collection of points $q_i$ within that region (representing a distance less than $r$ away from $p$).
